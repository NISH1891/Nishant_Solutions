Problem 1: Attached, stock tickers of a few DOW companies for two quarters. 
If percentage week-over-week gain/loss of the opening price is a key performance indicator, which tickers -- in 
descending order -- are the leaders and laggers in the portfolio averaged across all the quarters. (Tests data engineering/shaping skills)

 

Problem 2: Garfield -- a lazy cat -- is a big TV fan. It turns out that Garfield, on a few days, skips TV. 
If you were tasked to design a TVitcharooBot that presumably schedules DVR (on days that Garfield likely skips the TV) 
based on his daily routine -- for the attached behavioral/activity data -- what leading indicators can the TVitcharooBot use to figure Garfield's 
TV propensity? (tests data science skills)

 

Problem 3: Given IATA (airport) has a certain demand, plot a single temporal/weekly heatmap (preferably interactive) 
of the data to highlight peaks-n-lows. You may additionally use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports.dat 
(for extended information) to visualize a geomap. If you can optionally forecast demand through month of Jan 2020 at the airport level, 
that will be great. (tests EDA and visualization skills)

 

Problem 4: A traveler’s PNR flight data is attached. For the traveler, in 2018, we want to aggregate total trip spend, 
total mile count, number of “valid” trips, distinct cities visited. Additionally, if you can infer the traveler’s home city
code and use it to qualify each trip (which is a collection of segments) as round trip or one-way, that will be a huge advantage. 
(tests big data aggregation skills).
